It seems\\n\\nlike we add more uncertainty to the problem. However, when you add unlabeled examples, you add more\\n\\ninformation about your problem: a larger sample reﬂects better the probability distribution the data we\\n\\nlabeled came from. Theoretically, a learning algorithm should be able to leverage this additional information.\\n\\nAndriy Burkov\\n\\nThe Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book - Draft\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPage 9:\\n\\n1.3\\n\\nHow Supervised Learning Works\\n\\nIn this section, I brieﬂy explain how supervised learning works so that you have the picture\\n\\nof the whole process before we go into detail. I decided to use supervised learning as an\\n\\nexample because it’s the type of machine learning most frequently used in practice.\\n\\nThe supervised learning process starts with gathering the data. The data for supervised\\n\\nlearning is a collection of pairs (input, output). Input could be anything, for example, email\\n\\nmessages, pictures, or sensor measurements. Outputs are usually real numbers, or labels (e.g.\\n\\n“spam”, “not_spam”, “cat”, “dog”, “mouse”, etc). In some cases, outputs are vectors (e.g.,\\n\\nfour coordinates of the rectangle around a person on the picture), sequences (e.g. [“adjective”,\\n\\n“adjective”, “noun”] for the input “big beautiful car”), or have some other structure.\\n\\nLet’s say the problem that you want to solve using supervised learning is spam detection.\\n\\nYou gather the data, for example, 10,000 email messages, each with a label either “spam” or\\n\\n“not_spam” (you could add those labels manually or pay someone to do that for us). Now,\\n\\nyou have to convert each email message into a feature vector.\\n\\nThe data analyst decides, based on their experience, how to convert a real-world entity, such\\n\\nas an email message, into a feature vector. One common way to convert a text into a feature\\n\\nvector, called bag of words, is to take a dictionary of English words (let’s say it contains\\n\\n\\nYou ONLY have access to the following tools, and should NEVER make up tools that are not listed here:\\n\\nTool Name: Search a PDF\\'s content\\nTool Arguments: {\\n  \"description\": \"Input for PDFSearchTool.\",\\n  \"properties\": {\\n    \"query\": {\\n      \"description\": \"Mandatory query you want to use to search the PDF\\'s content\",\\n      \"title\": \"Query\",\\n      \"type\": \"string\"\\n    }\\n  },\\n  \"required\": [\\n    \"query\"\\n  ],\\n  \"title\": \"FixedPDFSearchToolSchema\",\\n  \"type\": \"object\",\\n  \"additionalProperties\": false\\n}\\nTool Description: A tool that can be used to semantic search a query the knowledge/MachineLearning.pdf PDF\\'s content.\\n\\nIMPORTANT: Use the following format in your response:\\n\\n```\\nThought: you should always think about what to do\\nAction: the action to take, only one name of [Search a PDF\\'s content], just the name, exactly as it\\'s written.\\nAction Input: the input to the action, just a simple JSON object, enclosed in curly braces, using \" to wrap keys and values.\\nObservation: the result of the action\\n```\\n\\nOnce all necessary information is gathered, return the following format:\\n\\n```\\nThought: I now know the final answer\\nFinal Answer: the final answer to the original input question\\n```'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Thought: I now know the final answer\\nFinal Answer: \\n1.2.3\\n\\nSemi-Supervised Learning\\n\\nIn semi-supervised learning, the dataset contains both labeled and unlabeled examples.\\n\\nUsually, the quantity of unlabeled examples is much higher than the number of labeled\\n\\nexamples.

The machine can execute actions in every state. Diﬀerent actions bring diﬀerent\\n\\nrewards and could also move the machine to another state of the environment. The goal\\n\\nof a reinforcement learning algorithm is to learn a policy. A policy is a function f (similar\\n\\nto the model in supervised learning) that takes the feature vector of a state as input and\\n\\noutputs an optimal action to execute in that state. The action is optimal if it maximizes the\\n\\nexpected average reward.\\n\\nReinforcement learning solves a particular kind of problems where\\n\\ndecision making is sequential, and the goal is long-term, such as game\\n\\nplaying, robotics, resource management, or logistics. In this book, I\\n\\nput emphasis on one-shot decision making where input examples are\\n\\nindependent of one another and the predictions made in the past. I\\n\\nleave reinforcement learning out of the scope of this book.\\n\\n2It could look counter-intuitive that learning could beneﬁt from adding more unlabeled examples. It seems\\n\\nlike we add more uncertainty to the problem. However, when you add unlabeled examples, you add more\\n\\ninformation about your problem: a larger sample reﬂects better the probability distribution the data we\\n\\nlabeled came from.

I decided to use supervised learning as an\\n\\nexample because it’s the type of machine learning most frequently used in practice.\\n\\nThe supervised learning process starts with gathering the data. The data for supervised\\n\\nlearning is a collection of pairs (input, output). Input could be anything, for example, email\\n\\nmessages, pictures, or sensor measurements. Outputs are usually real numbers, or labels (e.g.\\n\\n“spam”, “not_spam”, “cat”, “dog”, “mouse”, etc). In some cases, outputs are vectors (e.g.,\\n\\nfour coordinates of the rectangle around a person on the picture), sequences (e.g. [“adjective”,\\n\\n“adjective”, “noun”] for the input “big beautiful car”), or have some other structure.\\n\\nLet’s say the problem that you want to solve using supervised learning is spam detection.\\n\\nYou gather the data, for example, 10,000 email messages, each with a label either “spam” or\\n\\n“not_spam” (you could add those labels manually or pay someone to do that for us). Now,\\n\\nyou have to convert each email message into a feature vector.\\n\\nThe data analyst decides, based on their experience, how to convert a real-world entity, such\\n\\nas an email message, into a feature vector.
